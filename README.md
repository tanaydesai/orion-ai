# Orion AI - Interactive Space Simulation

A Next.js application featuring stunning space physics simulations with realistic black hole and orbital mechanics.

## Features

- **Black Hole Simulation**: Advanced gravitational physics with realistic particle effects, accretion disk, and visual distortion
- **Solar System Simulation**: Accurate orbital mechanics with planets, moons, and atmospheric effects
- **Interactive Physics**: Matter.js-powered physics engine with customizable parameters
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all devices

## Technologies

- Next.js 14
- React
- Matter.js Physics Engine
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Animations

The application features highly optimized animations:

- **Black Hole**: Realistic gravitational pull with colorful particle effects that spiral inward
- **Orbital Systems**: Accurate orbital mechanics with glowing sun, planets with atmospheres, and orbiting moons
- **Particle Effects**: Dynamic particle systems with realistic physics

## Customization

Simulations can be customized through JSON configuration to adjust:
- Gravity strength and direction
- Object properties (size, mass, color)
- Force field behaviors (attraction, repulsion)
- Particle emitter settings
